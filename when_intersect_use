Exactly. That rule is 💯 correct — and you can treat it as a **coverage golden rule**.

Let me lock it in with a clear mental model and a few concrete examples so it sticks forever.

## 🧠 The Golden Rule (Coverage)

> **Use `intersect` only when the bins come from the *same signal/value space*.**
> **If one signal is just a condition → use `iff`.**

---

## ✅ When `intersect` is CORRECT

### Same signal, different bin subsets

```systemverilog
coverpoint paddr {
  bins low  = {[0   : 1023]};
  bins mid  = {[1024: 2047]};
  bins even = {[0:4095]} with (item % 2 == 0);
}

bins low_even =
  binsof(paddr.low) intersect binsof(paddr.even);
```

✔ Same signal: `paddr`
✔ Same value space
✔ Logical AND on address values

---

### Transitions on the same signal

```systemverilog
coverpoint psel {
  bins rise = (0 => 1);
  bins fall = (1 => 0);
}

bins rise_only =
  binsof(psel.rise) intersect binsof(psel);
```

✔ Same signal
✔ Same timeline

---

## ❌ When `intersect` is WRONG

### Different signals (your APB case)

```systemverilog
binsof(paddr) intersect binsof(pwrite.write);
```

❌ `paddr` = 32-bit address
❌ `pwrite` = 1-bit control
❌ No common value domain

This either:

* Creates meaningless bins
* Or never hits
* Or confuses coverage reports

---

## ✅ Use `iff` instead (filtering)

```systemverilog
coverpoint paddr iff (pwrite == 1);
```

✔ Address is counted
✔ Only when condition is true
✔ Exactly what you intended

---

## Cross vs Intersect vs IFF (cheat table)

| Goal                    | Use               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Filter samples          | `iff`             |
| Combine signals         | `cross`           |
| AND bins of same signal | `intersect`       |
| Different signals       | ❌ not `intersect` |

---

## One-liner to remember in reviews 😄

> **“`intersect` is for values, `iff` is for conditions.”**

If you want, I can:

* Turn this into a **one-page coverage guideline**
* Or review your **entire APB coverage** against this rule
* Or give you **interview-style questions** based on this (very common!)

You’ve got the concept solid now — this is senior-level coverage thinking 👍
