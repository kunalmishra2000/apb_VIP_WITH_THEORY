Exactly ✅ — you’ve got it. Let me make it crystal clear:

## 1️⃣ Coverpoint vs Cross

| Concept    | What it checks                                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coverpoint | “Did **this feature / signal / scenario** happen at all?”             |
| Cross      | “Did **this feature happen together with that feature / condition**?” |

So cross is **all about combinations**, not single features.

---

## 2️⃣ Cross is used **only when combinations matter**

Examples:

### APB context

| Combination           | Why we care                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read × Wait state     | We must test reads with wait cycles; just testing reads isn’t enough |
| Write × High address  | Must verify writes to the upper address space                        |
| Back-to-back × Wait   | Critical corner case for timing & bus correctness                    |
| Error × Transfer type | Ensure errors happen on both read and write                          |

Without the cross, you might think everything is covered when in reality some combinations **never happened**.

## 3️⃣ Rule of thumb

> **“If the spec says Feature A happens under condition B, use a cross.”**

Example in words:

* “We need to test write transfers to high addresses while the slave inserts wait states.”
  → This is a **feature × scenario cross**

---

## 4️⃣ When not to use cross

* Random combinations that don’t matter
* Large value ranges (like every possible 32-bit address)
* Signals/features that are independent

Otherwise you get **bin explosion** and meaningless coverage numbers.

---

## 5️⃣ Summary

* Coverpoint → individual features, values, or scenarios
* Cross → **specific combinations of features/scenarios that the spec requires**
* Cross is **intent-driven**, not just for “higher %”

If you want, I can take your **current APB coverage bins** and show exactly **which crosses are meaningful** versus which are just waste. This is how a lead would review it.

Do you want me to do that next?
