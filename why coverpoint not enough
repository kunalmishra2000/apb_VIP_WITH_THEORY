Exactly — you’ve got the idea now. Let me put it in **simple words**:

---

## 1️⃣ Coverpoint only

* A **coverpoint** looks at **one variable at a time**.
* It tells you **which values of that variable were exercised**.
* It **does NOT** tell you which values happened together with other variables.

Example:

```systemverilog
coverpoint mode { bins 0,1,2,3; }
coverpoint key  { bins 0,1; }
```

* Mode coverpoint → tells you **which modes were tested** (0,1,2,3)
* Key coverpoint → tells you **which keys were tested** (0,1)

If a **random test** hits mode=0 and key=0, the coverpoints will mark **mode 0 hit, key 0 hit**.
But they **won’t tell you** if mode=0 & key=1 was ever tested.

---

## 2️⃣ Why this is important

* **Coverpoints only** are good to check **individual variable activity**.
* They **don’t guarantee coverage of feature combinations** — so **some bugs can be missed**.

> Random tests may or may not hit all combinations.
> Coverpoints only tell you what **was exercised**, not what **needs to be exercised together**.

---

## 3️⃣ Cross coverage

* **Cross coverage** solves this by checking **combinations** of variables.
* Example: `cross mode, key;` → will tell you exactly which mode/key pairs were exercised.
* This ensures **all features and scenarios** (like mode 3 + key 1) are tested.

---

### ✅ Analogy

* **Coverpoint** → checks **rows** and **columns** individually.
* **Cross** → checks the **squares** of the grid (row × column combinations).

Without cross → some squares might be **empty** even if rows and columns are full.

---

So yes: **coverpoints = individual variable coverage**
**Cross = combination coverage**

---

If you want, I can make a **small visual 16×4 grid example** showing what coverpoints see vs what cross sees — it makes this very clear.

Do you want me to do that?
