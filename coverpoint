This is a **very good question**, because there is no fixed number — and knowing *how to decide the number* is what separates junior vs solid verification engineers 👍
Let me explain this in a **practical, structured way**.

---

## First: there is NO magic number

There is **no rule** like:

* “10 features is enough”
* “20 scenarios is required”

Instead, the number comes from:

> **The specification + risk + verification plan**

---

## The correct process (this is what actually happens)

### Step 1️⃣ Read the spec → extract FEATURES

A **feature** is:

> A capability explicitly promised by the design

For APB, typical features are:

### APB feature examples

| Feature type   | Example                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Transfer type  | Read, Write            |
| Timing         | Zero wait, Wait states |
| Throughput     | Back-to-back           |
| Addressing     | Address decode         |
| Error handling | PSLVERR                |
| Reset behavior | Reset during idle      |

Usually **5–10 features** for a simple APB slave.

---

## Step 2️⃣ For each feature → define SCENARIOS

A **scenario** is:

> A meaningful way the feature can occur

### Example: “Read transfer” feature

Scenarios:

* Read with no wait
* Read with 1 wait
* Read with multiple waits
* Read back-to-back

So:

* 1 feature
* 3–5 scenarios

---

## Step 3️⃣ Identify CORNER scenarios

These are **high-risk** or **historically buggy** cases:

* Wait state at boundary
* Back-to-back across address regions
* Read → write transition

Usually **1–3 corner scenarios per feature**.

---

## Step 4️⃣ Convert to coverpoints and bins

### Rule of thumb (very important)

| Item                  | Typical count |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Features              | 5–12          |
| Scenarios per feature | 2–6           |
| Total bins            | ~30–80        |

This is **healthy, reviewable coverage**.

---

## Concrete APB example

### Features (6)

1. Read transfer
2. Write transfer
3. Wait-state support
4. Back-to-back transfer
5. Error response
6. Reset handling

---

### Scenarios (example)

| Feature      | Scenarios                |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Read         | no wait, multi wait      |
| Write        | no wait, multi wait      |
| Wait         | 1 cycle, >1 cycle        |
| Back-to-back | rd→rd, wr→wr, wr→rd      |
| Error        | read error, write error  |
| Reset        | reset idle, reset active |

That’s about **15–20 scenarios**.

---

## How this maps to coverpoints

### Feature coverpoint

```systemverilog
coverpoint apb_feature {
  bins read;
  bins write;
  bins wait;
  bins back_to_back;
  bins error;
}
```

### Scenario coverpoint

```systemverilog
coverpoint apb_scenario {
  bins rd_no_wait;
  bins rd_multi_wait;
  bins wr_no_wait;
  bins wr_multi_wait;
  bins wr_to_rd;
}
```

---

## What NOT to do (very common mistake)

❌ One bin per signal value
❌ One bin per testcase
❌ “Cover everything just in case”

That leads to:

* Huge bin count
* Meaningless percentages
* Unreviewable coverage

---

## How leads decide “enough coverage”

They ask:

1. Are all spec features covered?
2. Are risky scenarios covered?
3. Are uncovered bins justified?

If yes → **coverage is sufficient**, even if it’s “only” 40 bins.

---

## One sentence to remember

> **You don’t count bins — you count verification intent.**

---

## If you want, next I can:

* Take an APB spec and **derive features & scenarios together**
* Review your coverage and say **what to drop / keep**
* Help you answer this in an **interview-style explanation**

Just tell me 👍
