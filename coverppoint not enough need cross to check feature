Ah! Now this is a **critical point** — this is where many beginners get confused. Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## 1️⃣ What happens if you **only use coverpoints** (no cross)

Suppose you have `mode` and `key`:

```systemverilog
coverpoint mode { bins 0,1,2,3; }
coverpoint key  { bins 0,1; }
```

* Coverpoints **individually** track which modes were exercised, and which keys were exercised.
* **But you do NOT track combinations**.

Example scenario:

| Mode | Key | Hit? |
| ---- | --- | ---- |
| 0    | 0   | ✔    |
| 0    | 1   | ❌    |
| 1    | 0   | ✔    |
| 1    | 1   | ❌    |

* `mode` coverpoint will report 0 and 1 **hit** ✅
* `key` coverpoint will report 0 **hit** ✅
* **You will have no idea** that `(0,1)` and `(1,1)` combinations never happened ❌

---

## 2️⃣ Why that matters

Some bugs **only appear for specific combinations**. For example:

* Mode 0 + Key 1 → causes a reset issue
* Mode 1 + Key 0 → normal operation

If you don’t cross, your coverage will **say 100% for mode and key**, but you might have **missed critical combinations**.

> So coverage looks “green” but the test **didn’t actually exercise all features**.

---

## 3️⃣ When you can skip cross

You **don’t need cross** if:

* The features are **independent**, i.e., mode doesn’t affect key behavior
* You only care about **individual signal coverage**, not combinations

Otherwise, **always use cross** for **meaningful feature combinations**.

---

## 4️⃣ Simple analogy

Think of `mode` and `key` as a **grid**:

```
      Key0  Key1
Mode0   ✔     ❌
Mode1   ✔     ❌
```

* **Coverpoints only**: you see that Mode0 and Mode1 are covered, Key0 is covered ✅
* **Cross**: you see exactly **which squares are missing** ❌

Without cross, you **cannot guarantee coverage of all squares**.

---

### ✅ Takeaway

* Coverpoints → check individual features
* Cross → check **interactions / combinations**
* Skipping cross = possible **holes in your coverage**

---

If you want, I can rewrite your **mode/key coverage with cross** for the full 16×4 case **and show which combinations are hit/missed** — it makes it **super visual and easy to understand**.

Do you want me to do that?
