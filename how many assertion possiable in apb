Short answer first: **there is no fixed “maximum” number of assertions for APB3** 🙂
The number depends on **how deep you want to verify** and **what role you’re checking (master, slave, or bus monitor)**.

That said, in *real verification projects*, APB3 typically ends up with **~20 to 40 solid assertions**. Let me break that down so it makes sense.

---

## Why there’s no max number

APB3 is:

* Simple protocol
* Level-based
* No burst, no IDs, no out-of-order

But assertions can be written at **different granularities**:

* Signal-level
* Phase-level
* FSM-level
* Data stability
* Error handling
* Optional design rules

Each rule can be **1 big assertion** or **several small ones**.

---

## Typical APB3 assertion breakdown

### 1️⃣ Reset rules (2–4)

Examples:

* `PSEL == 0` during reset
* `PENABLE == 0` during reset
* No X/Z on bus after reset

👉 **~3 assertions**

---

### 2️⃣ Basic protocol sequencing (6–8)

Examples:

* IDLE → SETUP
* SETUP → ACCESS (next cycle mandatory)
* ACCESS → IDLE or SETUP
* PENABLE only high when PSEL is high
* No skipping SETUP phase

👉 **~7 assertions**

---

### 3️⃣ READY / wait-state rules (5–7)

Examples:

* PENABLE remains high until PREADY
* PSEL remains high until PREADY
* PREADY only sampled in ACCESS
* No READY in SETUP phase

👉 **~6 assertions**

---

### 4️⃣ Address & control stability (4–6)

Examples:

* PADDR stable until READY
* PWRITE stable until READY
* PWDATA stable for write
* No change during wait states

👉 **~5 assertions**

---

### 5️⃣ Read/write correctness (4–6)

Examples:

* PRDATA valid only when READY
* PRDATA stable when READY low
* PWDATA only valid during write
* No X on PRDATA when READY

👉 **~5 assertions**

---

### 6️⃣ Error handling (APB3 specific) (2–4)

Examples:

* PSLVERR only asserted when READY
* PSLVERR only in ACCESS phase

👉 **~3 assertions**

---

### 7️⃣ Illegal / defensive checks (optional, 4–8)

Examples:

* No X/Z on critical signals
* No PENABLE glitches
* No PSEL drop before READY

👉 **~6 assertions**

## 🔢 Realistic totals

| Verification depth               | Assertion count |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Minimal sanity                   | 10–15           |
| **Normal project (most common)** | **20–30**       |
| Very strict / VIP-like           | 35–45           |
| Formal-quality checker           | 50+             |

---

## What matters more than the number 💡

Interviewers and leads **don’t care about the count**. They care about:

* Do you cover **all protocol rules**?
* Are assertions **simple and debuggable**?
* Do they catch **real bugs**, not just pass sims?

10 *good* assertions > 50 bad ones.

---

## Best practice (real-world tip)

👉 Write **one assertion per rule**
👉 Split when debug matters
👉 Add coverage after assertions

If you want, I can:

* Give you a **checklist of must-have APB3 assertions**
* Show how **Cadence/ARM VIPs** structure theirs
* Help you explain this answer perfectly in an **interview**

Just tell me 😄
